**Problem Solving in Data Structures and Algorithms**
**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

In Project One, the challenge was to develop a program for the ABCU Computer Science department that efficiently manages course data, including sorting and retrieving course information along with prerequisites. Project Two focused on implementing a solution to sort and display the Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

**How did you approach the problem?**

Understanding the importance of data structures, I evaluated different options (Vector, Hash Table, Tree) to determine the most suitable one for each project's requirements. The choice of data structure was crucial to optimize for either quick access or ordered data management.

**Overcoming Roadblocks**

Encountering roadblocks, particularly in handling large datasets and ensuring efficient data retrieval, I iteratively tested and refined the code. Debugging and seeking feedback were key strategies in resolving issues.


**Expanding Software Design Approach**
**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

This project has deepened my understanding of how the choice of data structures and algorithms fundamentally shapes software efficiency and functionality. It highlighted the importance of considering both current and future needs of the software, ensuring scalability and maintainability.


**Evolution in Programming Practices**
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I've grown more attentive to writing clean, well-documented code. Implementing modular design and choosing appropriate data structures have become central to my development process, ensuring that my programs are not only functional but also maintainable and adaptable to changing requirements.
